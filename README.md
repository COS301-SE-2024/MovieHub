    I am a computer science student from the University of Pretoria. I excel in building modern web applications that deliver seamless user experience. I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge in full stack development. Fun fact: I nearly traded in my keyboard for a paintbrush and pursued a degree in fine arts. Glad I stuck with coding – less mess, more debugging!

# Branching Strategy #
We will use GitFlow as our branching strategy, as such we will have main, development and feature branches.
![image](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2024/MovieHub/assets/40609889/cd25443f-1e72-4d25-a7d6-37e84984c0e4)

Once develop has acquired enough features for a release (or a predetermined release date is approaching), you fork a release branch off of develop. Creating this branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this point—only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch. Once it's ready to ship, the release branch gets merged into main and tagged with a version number. In addition, it should be merged back into develop, which may have progressed since the release was initiated.

Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly patch production releases. Hotfix branches are a lot like release branches and feature branches except they're based on main instead of the develop branch. This is the only branch that should fork directly off of main. As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both main and develop (or the current release branch), and main should be tagged with an updated version number.

# Branch Naming Convention #
To make sure everyone knows exactly where each branch is located, we will follow this naming convention:
main\
development\
dev/backend\
dev/frontend\
All feature branches must be named as follows:\
dev/environment/feature/sub-feature\
For example:\
dev/back/auth/login\
This implies that there is an authentication branch that was branched from backend and furthermore a login branch was then branched from there.\
